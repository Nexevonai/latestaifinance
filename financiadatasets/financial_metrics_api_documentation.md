## ðŸ‘‹ Overview
The historical financial metrics API provides historical financial metrics and ratios for a given stock ticker.

Financial metrics include a company's valuation, profitability, efficiency, liquidity, leverage, growth, and per share metrics over a specified period.

To get started, please create an account and grab your API key at financialdatasets.ai.

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

## ðŸ“Š Available Tickers
You can fetch a list of available tickers with a GET request to: https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financial-metrics/tickers/

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:

1. Add your API key to the header of the request as X-API-KEY.
2. Add query params like ticker to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

## ðŸ”Ž Filtering the Data
You can filter the data by ticker, period, limit, and report_period.

Note: ticker and period are required. By default, limit is 4 and report_period is null.

The period parameter can be set to annual, quarterly, or ttm (trailing twelve months). The limit parameter is used to specify the number of periods to return.

The report_period parameter is used to specify the date of the financial metrics. For example, you can include filters like report_period_lte=2024-09-30 and report_period_gte=2024-01-01 to get financial metrics between January 1, 2024 and September 30, 2024.

The available report_period operations are:

- report_period_lte
- report_period_lt
- report_period_gte
- report_period_gt
- report_period
